 <h3>Why is it different?</h3>

> Secure Password Generator is different from most password generators because it outputs a random password that is readable by a normal human yet still secure. It does this by providing an easy to remember reminder that will remind the user of what their password is.  

 <h3>How was it built?</h3>

> Secure Password Generator was built using <b>PySide6</b>, the python <b>random</b> package, and the python <b>string</b> package.
